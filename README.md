# IntraQuant
This project leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and quantitative strategies to develop an intelligent stock trading platform tailored for the Indian stock market. The platform analyzes historical market data, real-time news sentiment, and technical indicators to recommend the top 10 stocks to buy and sell each day for intraday trading. Combining machine learning, natural language processing, and advanced financial modeling, the project aims to empower traders with actionable insights, optimize returns, and minimize risks. With a focus on automation and precision, it provides a seamless interface for traders to make data-driven decisions and stay ahead in the dynamic financial markets.
